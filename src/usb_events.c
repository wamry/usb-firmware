 *
 * Input:           USB_EVENT event - the type of event
 *                  void *pdata - pointer to the event data
 *                  uint16_t size - size of the event data

 * Output:          None
 *
 * Side Effects:    None
 *
 * Overview:        This function is called from the USB stack to
 *                  notify a user application that a USB event
 *                  occurred.  This callback is in interrupt context
 *                  when the USB_INTERRUPT option is selected.
 *
 * Note:            None
